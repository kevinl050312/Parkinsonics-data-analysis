# Parkinsonics-data-analysis
Exploratory and subsequent data analyses on clinical dataset consisting of questionnaire responses and vocal measurements collected from study participants with Parkinson's Disease. The contents of this repo consist of my own analyses using Python in Jupyter notebooks, and of the de-identified patient data which was analyzed.

The study aimed to determine the efficacy and potential viability of group singing sessions on PD patients' quality of life, and was published in September 2022 to the Hindawi Parkinson's Disease journal: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/pd/2022/4233203/
